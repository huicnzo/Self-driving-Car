A lot of companies are working on self-driving cars and trucks.As traffic accidents are on the rise, automated driving systems have the potential to transform our transportation system into one that is safer and more secure for everyone. Various kinds of data are fed to the system of self-driving cars like Image Data (cameras [front side, rear side]), LIDAR [3-D geometry], RADAR, GPS, Ultrasonic sensors, etc. Outputs predicted are Steering wheel angle, acceleration,  braking. In this project, a part of the Self-Driving Cars  System is implemented using Convolutional Neural Networks . Images  from the dashcam  wil be feeded Convolutional Neural Network and the label corresponding to those images will be the steering angle. Model will learn the steering angle from as per the turns in the image and will finally predict steering angle for unknown images.The predictions of the model will be tested in a simulation .
