a lot of companies that are working on self-driving cars and trucks. Various kinds of data are fed to the system of self-driving cars like Image Data (cameras [front side, rear side]), LIDAR [3-D geometry], RADAR, GPS, Ultrasonic sensors, etc. Outputs predicted are Steering wheel angle, acceleration,  braking. In this project, a part of the Self-Driving Cars  System is implemented using Convolutional Neural Networks. Dataset of the dashcam is taken to train CNN Model and then predict the Steering wheel angle.
