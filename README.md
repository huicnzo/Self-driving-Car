These days, a great many Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), otherwise called selfdriving
vehicles, are on streets. AVs are expected to establish 25% of vehicles
worldwide in 2035. Steering angle prediction is basic in the control of Autonomous
Vehicles (AVs) and has pulled in the consideration of researchers, makers, and insurance
agencies in the car business. In this project Convolutional Neural Network
model has been applied to predict the steering angle of AVs in different situations.
Different sorts of data are fed to the system of Autonomous Vehicles like Image Data
(cameras [front side, rear side]), LIDAR [3-D geometry], RADAR, GPS, Ultrasonic
sensors, etc. Outputs predicted are Steering wheel angle, acceleration, braking. In
this project, a section of the Self-Driving Cars System is implemented using Convolutional
Neural Networks. Dataset of the dashcam is taken to train CNN Model.
The model will learn the steering wheel angle from the dataset as per the turns in the
image and then predict the steering wheel angle. The predictions of the model will
be tested in a simulation.
